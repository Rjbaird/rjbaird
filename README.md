## From Mobile Expert to Software Developer
My interest in software development started while I was working sales at Best Buy Mobile. In my free time, I learned about mobile automation software like IFTTT, Tasker, and Zapier. While not full on development, I grew a solid understanding of concepts such as functions, variables, conditionals, loops, testing, and error handling. As my interest grew, I moved on to full-fledged programming languages, primarily Javascript. 


## What am I doing now?
Right now, I'm using my sales and Javascript skills to help small businesses increase their productivity with custom automations. My main work is with G Suite and Google Apps Scripts. I also help create IoT integrations with services like IFTTT and Zapier.


## Future Goals and Hobbies
In my free time, I create personal automations with Siri Shortcuts, manage my home with Home Assistant on a Raspberry Pi and create personal assistants with Slack bots. I'm also learning more about databases and how to work with Serverless technologies like Firebase and AWS.
